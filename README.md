# Isaac Yates

Web Developer | Barista

## Technical Overview

Over the last couple years since leaving college I've been learning ReactJS, NextJS, Svelte & Sveltekit (used to be Sapper), ExpressJS, MongoDb, and the basics of HTTP. I've also worked with TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and SASS. I have passing familiarity with Django, Flask, Docker, and Docker-Compose. For my personal projects, I deploy to Vercel and host images on AWS S3. I've become a big fan of fullstack Javascript, but I'm looking to get involved in fullstack, frontend, or backend web development.

## Philosophy

I would like to build experiences that interface with real life, as opposed to swallowing users into the depths of the internet. Technology is best used when it augments and boosts our relationships with nature, the universe, and other people.
