Hi! That's me!

I'm a barista and a web-development enthusiast. For the past few years since leaving college (Computer Science, University of Oklahoma) I have been working in craft coffee shops. I've reach an inflection point in my life though, and am ready to take my knowledge of people and software development to the next horizon. :)

Please, if you're hiring or would just like to chit chat, shoot me a message on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-yates-572441116/) profile or drop me a message via [this handy form](https://yatescreative.com/contact) on my website.
