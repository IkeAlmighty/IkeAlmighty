# Isaac Yates

Web Developer | Barista

## Technical Overview

Over the last couple years since leaving college I've been learning ReactJS, NextJS, Svelte & Sveltekit, ExpressJS, MongoDb, and the basics of HTTP. I've also worked with TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and SASS. I have passing familiarity with Django, Flask, Docker, and Docker-Compose. For my personal projects, I deploy to Vercel and host images on AWS S3. I've become a big fan of fullstack Javascript, but I'm looking to get involved in fullstack, frontend, or backend web development.

## Philosophy

I would like to build experiences that interface with real life, as opposed to swallowing users into the depths of the internet. Technology is best used when it augments and boosts our relationships with nature, the universe, and other people.

## Projects

You can see my favorite projects stickied to my profile below. Here is quick summary of each:

### [sorcerersoup.com](https://github.com/ikealmighty/sorcerersoup.git)

A long term passion project, Sorcerer Soup is my take on what I call a Computer Assisted Role Playing Game, or CARPG. The includes a tool for generating spells from a simple templating language that I designed, and also has a short application wizard for creating characters. It's an ongoing project that I intend to add many interesting features to!

### [Take Ike's Stuff](https://github.com/ikealmighty/takeikesstuff.git)

Sort of like a digital give-away or garage sale, takeikesstuff is a web app I built to help me get rid of stuff before I moved from Oklahoma to Minnesota. _Built with NextJS, JWT, AWS S3, Mongodb, and TailwindCSS._

### [Yates Creative](https://github.com/ikealmighty/yatescreative.git)

Yates Creative is the home to my creative pursuits. It includes a portfolio, some poetry, pictures of my latte art, and whatever else comes my mind. _Built with NextJS, Mongodb, AWS S3, and TailwindCSS._
