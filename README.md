## Technical Overview

Over the last couple years since leaving college I've been learning ReactJS, NextJS, Svelte & Sveltekit, ExpressJS, MongoDb, and the basics of HTTP. I've also worked with TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, and SASS. I have passing familiarity with Django, Flask, Docker, and Docker-Compose. For my personal projects, I deploy to Vercel and host images on AWS S3 or Blackblaze. I've become a big fan of fullstack Javascript, but I'm looking to get involved in fullstack, frontend, or backend web development.

## Philosophy

I would like to build experiences that interface with real life, as opposed to swallowing users into the depths of the internet. Technology is best used when it augments and boosts our relationships with nature, the universe, and other people.

## Projects

You can see my favorite projects stickied to my profile below. Here is quick summary of each:

### [scones.ike.coffee](https://github.com/ikealmighty/scones.ike.coffee.git)

I created this website for my side business of selling scones in South Minneapolis. It is my first project to successfully integrate Stripe payment API, and I hope to eventually grow it into a full blown custom POS for a coffee shop. I've also included a community board for users to upload images that I moderate, as well as an automated email alert system to let me know when someone places an order. The website has held up under a little bit of stress, as I make anywhere from $50 to $200 a month from it.

### [sorcerersoup.com](https://github.com/ikealmighty/sorcerersoup.git)

A long term passion project, Sorcerer Soup is my take on what I call a Computer Assisted Role Playing Game, or CARPG. The includes a tool for generating spells from a simple templating language that I designed, and also has a short application wizard for creating characters. It's an ongoing project that I intend to add many interesting features to!

### [Sweet Treats](https://github.com/ikealmighty/sweet-treats.git)

Sweet Treats is a group project that I collaborated with other Edex Bootcamp students on. Although I executed the same idea more fully in scones.ike.coffee on my own, sweet treats was my first team project in which I utilized git flow and pull requests.
